# Arcade-Game-Clone-Project
Clone the repo to your local system and open index.html to play the game

## Instructions of implementation
1) Player cannot move off-screen
2) Vehicles cross the screen
3) Vehicle-Player collision happens logically
4) Vehicle player collision resets the game
5) Something happens when player wins(i.e reaches water)

## Game-Instructions
Game Starts with 0 score and 3 lives
1) Use arrows to move the player
2) Collect gem to earn 2 points
3) Reach water to gain 1 point
4) If you collide with the bug(enemy) then you lose one life and come to starting position
5) Collect hearts to gain one life
6) If player is bitten by bug when he has zero life then the game restarts(i.e 0 score and 3 lives)
